# Lbc Technical Test

## Versioning

Project is versioned under Git. Let's try as much as possible to follow commit msg formatting
described [here](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html).
## Building

Project uses gradle for building and for dependency management. In order to smooth modularization.
It uses precompiled gradle plugins.
